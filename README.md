This program was writen as learning execise, and so I could use this program for future reference.

This features: Direction strafe movement, object rotation, shooting projectiles with limited ammo, usage of Vector2
and adding an proper gui.

You are free to use this program as a reference for future projects, that basically what I'm gonna use this program
for from now on

This exercise is quite a big learning experience for me. Sometime during my last project, I switched from VSCode to
Pycharm because I thought the IDE looked cool and it made me feel like a real programmer. Especially since it has
this unity-like project selection screen. Of course I had to turn off some features like the grammer check because
it was so annoying
    
I would like to anknowledge how far I came with understanding how to handle multiple python files. Previously, I 
used to think that managing multiple python files would be a absolute nightmare with issues like cicular imports,
and the problem of how I would get important data around. Sure I attempted to do so multiple times before as you can
see by my other projects, but there would always to a flaw to them. However, as my understanding of python grew I
sorta managed to figure out a effective way to do it. Sure, there may be a better way of doing this instead of
typing a hundred import statments, so if there is, please let me know!
    
I now see multi-file python projects in a different light. You know about libraries? Those things that are mostly
comprised of files writen in python that you can import into your project so you can do things a long more easily?
(Although I think not all python libraries are written in python..) I realized that multi-file projects and
libraries aren't really that different after all. By starting a new project, you're basically creating a new 
library. I even found out that there's a "main" file in each library was well! It's kind of hard for me to explain.
    
I also experimented with the way I do things like the file structure, giving important system variables all caps 
names, adding if __name__ == '__main__'. (As if that's gonna do anything)

To play this, just run init.py
